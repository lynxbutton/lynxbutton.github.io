                    Howdy, I’m Lynx Button and I’m a 3rd year BSc (Hons) Computer Science for Games student at The University of Brighton. I love being part of a team that tackles the inner workings of a game to create a beautiful, well-functioning, and detailed final product that players can interact with. I am an efficient and strong programmer with passion for creating robust and creative games. I am also a hard worker who is incredibly time-efficient, having never missed a deadline in my education, and treat all my work with upmost care and precision. I have acquired relevant skills and knowledge including in C++, C#, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Unity and Unreal. I have been polishing my skills in these technologies and game design for over the past 4 years.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2021, I earned an extended diploma in Games and Interactive Media Design at Distinction level at Tresham College, Kettering. During these studies, I worked in small teams to design and program multiple genres of games using engines such as Unity and RenPy. I am knowledgeable in the basics of both Python, C# and C# in Unity. Within these studies I also kept up a journal, documenting my creative progress throughout my diploma as well as creating professional formatted documents such as Games Design Documents.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2021, I began studying Computer Science for Games at the University of Brighton in which I am on track to achieve a 2:1. Throughout my course so far, I have learnt a plethora of design skills and technologies. Some of my modules include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Games Design and Development – Grade: A </h4>
                            This module explored the fundamentals of designing games along with an introduction to Unity 3D. The aim of this module was to design and create a small RPG level with Unity and C#, which could be played on PC.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Games Programming – Grade: A-</h4>
                            Within this module, I was reintroduced into programming fundamentals with a focus on C++ and SDL. With this knowledge, I created a 3-level racing game which could be played on PC using C++ and SDL.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Web Development – Grade: A+</h4>
                            This module explored designing and creating a 3-page fully responsive website using HTML and CSS with a focus of making it user-friendly. The skills I learnt helped me to create this portfolio website!
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>3D Modelling and Animation – Grade: A- </h4>
                            In this module, I designed and created a storyboard for a game interaction and used this design to digitally model, texture and animate a 3D environment using Autodesk Maya.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Web-based Game Development – Grade: A </h4>
                            In this module, I enhanced my Phaser and JavaScript skills by designing and developing a point and click 2D platformer aimed at young girls, called <a href = "homeward.html">Homeward</a>.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Game Development Frameworks – Grade: A+</h4>
                            Within this module, I was introduced to Unreal Engine with a focus upon blueprints. I used what I learnt within this module to create an 3D platformer & RPG called: <a href = "HuntforBigPaw.html">The Hunt for Big Paw</a>.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Game Engine Fundamentals – Grade: A+</h4>
                            In this module, I was expected to take a basic 2D game engine built in C++ & SDL and expand it by adding a subsystem. I chose to expand it by creating an <a href = "XCube2D.html">animation subsystem</a> which focused upon allowing developers to use animations of many different frame rates at the same time.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the summer of 2023, I completed an internship role at Brighton Zoo Animation Company as a Junior Game Developer Intern. My main role within this internship was to design and develop interactive e-books for Okido Interactive to be experienced by young children on the World of Okido app.</p>
                <p>Within this internship, I strongly developed my skills in JavaScript and jQuery as well as many of my interpersonal skills such as communication, teamwork, time management and being receptive to feedback.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am currently seeking part-time work within the industry to apply and expand on the skills that I have established within my studies, and learn first-hand from industry professionals while continuing the final year of  my bachelor’s degree.
                </p>
