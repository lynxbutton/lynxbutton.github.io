                    The main goal of the player in Homeward is to get the doll to their child’s bed in their room without harming or losing the doll. Throughout the house there are many threats and roadblocks for the player to work around using other objects and tools in the area. The game is split into levels with each level representing a day in the doll’s life. These levels increase in difficulty as the player goes along. Homeward consists of 3 levels which each progressively get harder to complete. The first level serves similarly to a tutorial with only one step to a very simple puzzle which is laid out very clearly to the player. The second level is slightly more complex being a physics based and two-step puzzle to reach the end of the level. The third level uses both mechanics introduced in the last two levels and combines them.

                    This was an independent university project for my second year when studying Phaser and JavaScript. I focused heavily upon character design & pixel art illustration, as all assets are custom made by me for this project. On top of this I used this game as a crucial steppingstone in getting used to creating with Phaser and JavaScript.
