    "2": "Messy, Zim, Zam &amp; Zoom are at the beach...\nThe sea looks so flat, I can’t see anything moving. Is there any life underwater?\nWell Messy, the only way we can see is by going underwater!\n...To the Zeppelin!",
    "3": "Ready Messy? Let's dive in!\nBalabala- boomboom!",
    "4": "WOW! There’s a whole world   underwater and it’s full of life!",
    "5": "I need an air tank to breathe underwater. How do you breathe?\nFish have gills which help them breathe underwater.",
    "6": "To float, fish have a sack of air inside them, called a swim bladder.\nYou swim up and down and all around the ocean. How do you float?",
    "7": "Look at that school of fish! All the little fish together look like one big fish!\nWoah... it's dark down here in the deep sea - surely nothing lives here?\nNot many sandwiches down here... What do you eat?\nHaha! I eat fish! Follow me and I'll show you.\nLook! This fish has a light on its head - is that so it can see in the dark?",
    "8": "small fish\nmedium fish\nbig fish\nshrimp\nplankton\nshark\nThat's what we eat, Messy! I eat big fish, big fish eat smaller fish... That's the marine food chain!\nSome fish eat seaweeds.\nAll sea creatures feed  from each other.  Plankton feeds from  the sun, like plants.\nShrimps eat plankton and then small fish eat shrimps!\nLet's move the creatures to the right place in the food chain!",
    "9": "Ha! The sea isn't as quiet and empty as I thought!!! So many amazing creatures live in the sea...!"
