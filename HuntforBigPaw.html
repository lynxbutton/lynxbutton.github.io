                    The Hunt for Big Paw is a demo of a puzzle adventure game created within Unreal Engine with the use of Blueprints. The narrative of The Hunt for Big Paw follows Bone Retriever and Pointer as they investigate after a sighted Big Paw was reported to have torn apart a local’s garden. Pointer, a renown hunter, was called onto the scene to attempt to track down and capture the creature with the help of local archaeologist and zoologist Bone Retriever. As a team they work together to locate Big Paw and in turn investigate a hidden civilisation of creatures much bigger than them. There are three main characters within the narrative of The Hunt for Big Paw:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Pointer (She/Her) is a black and white Border Collie wearing a green neckerchief and belt. She is a determined hunter with strong physical capabilities and an unbending moral compass. Stubborn like no other, there’s no doubt that the Big Paw will be found.</li>
                        <li>Bone Retriever (They/Them) is a golden Labrador Retriever wearing a red scarf with a brown backpack and hat. They are an expert in their field with rumours saying they once found proof the LochMutt Monster actually exists, however now they refuse to leave this small village on the edge of nowhere. Maybe they know something the others don’t.</li>
                        <li>The Lesser Spotted Big Paw (He/Him) is the clumsiest of all Big Paws and is often the blame for the sightings that occur. He has a morbid curiosity towards other dogs, often nicknaming them Small Paws, which constantly lands him in trouble.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p class = "flat-on-wrap">
                    This was an independent university project for my second year when studying Unreal engine. I focused heavily upon story, character design & modelling as well as strong subsystem design and implementation with the game’s sniffing mechanic. This mechanic gives players the option for their dog to sniff the air and locate objects that are close by. They will then be able to navigate to these objects and dig them up. These objects could be used for story progression, healing, or puzzles.
