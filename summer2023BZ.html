                    In the summer of 2023, I completed an internship role at <a href = "https://www.brighton-zoo.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brighton Zoo Animation Company</a> 
                    as a Junior Game Developer Intern. My main role within this internship was to design and develop interactive e-books for 
                    <a href = "https://www.okido.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Okido Interactive</a> to be experienced by young children on the <a href = "https://www.okido.com/okido-app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">World of Okido app</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During my time at Brighton Zoo, I developed two e-books which were based upon the Okido educational comics: Underwater & Numbers. 
                    These were created using the following technologies: Pubcoder, HTML, CSS, JavaScript & jQuery. 
                    Throughout creating these e-books, I heavily focused on designing engaging interactions which could be easily understood by 
                    a young audience while thematically fitting the base comic and its themes to create the most enjoyable and fun experience for children. 
                    On top of this I focused on developing my skills in JavaScript & jQuery as well as many of my interpersonal skills such as 
                    communication, teamwork, time management & being receptive to feedback.

                            <p>The first e-book I completed followed Messy, Zim, Zam & Zoom into the deep blue sea to investigate and learn about life in the ocean. The book teaches children about some of the animals that can be found in the ocean, how they breathe and float and how their food chain works.</p>
                            <p>Throughout the creation of this e-book, I heavily focused on learning more about Pubcoder, JavaScript & jQuery and aimed to have one key interaction per page. The result of this focus was a rich interaction focused experience which could simulate the busy feeling of the sea while captivating a young audience.</p>

                            <p>The second e-book I completed followed Messy, Zim, Zam & Zoom into Geoffrey’s café where they find out that the till has broken. The group decides to help and calculate the orders themselves while Zam fixes the till. The book teaches children about adding numbers together to achieve an order total as well as how to tally numbers up.</p>
                            <p>Throughout the creation of this e-book, I focused on following a structured format where there would be simple interactions throughout the e-book with a game at the end on the last page. I took a larger role in designing aspects of this e-book’s interactions and aimed to create an easy-to-understand addition game which would request children to put what they have learnt to the test in a small quiz.</p>
